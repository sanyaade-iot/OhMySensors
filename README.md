# OhMySensors [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/marvinroger/OhMySensors.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/marvinroger/OhMySensors) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/marvinroger/OhMySensors/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/marvinroger/OhMySensors) [![Test Coverage](https://codeclimate.com/github/marvinroger/OhMySensors/badges/coverage.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/marvinroger/OhMySensors/coverage)

OhMySensors is my attempt at creating an home automation controller for [MySensors](http://www.mysensors.org/). I was not able to find a controller that supports every single aspect of the MySensors Protocol, other than the commercial Vera. So I decided to build my own cheapest alternative (understand free). This project is in very early stage, and is only for now a personal project.

## Goals

- [x] Free
- [ ] Support every feature of MySensors
- [x] Compatible with multiple types of Gateway
  - [x] Ethernet Gateway
  - [x] Serial Gateway
- [x] Dependency-less (except NPM modules) 
- [ ] Material dashboard
